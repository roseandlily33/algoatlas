## Description
A leetcode like application where I made desired changes to fit how I would like to learn. When I came up with the idea I had about 5 different files containing alogrithms from different parts of my learning journey, always wanting to revist not see the answer right away from those and getting confused on the amount of notes that some files were getting I decided to compartimentalize everything having algorithms within a leetcode style, I wanted to be able to track my progress, type in my answer, review, see techniques and have it all in a centralized location to continuously review and not just have notes upon notes.
