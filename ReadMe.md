## Overview

AlgoAtlas is a personalized LeetCode-style platform designed to help you master algorithms and data structures in a way that fits your learning style. Inspired by my own journey—juggling multiple files, scattered notes, and the need for structured review—I built AlgoAtlas to centralize everything: algorithm problems, solutions, notes, progress tracking, and more.

## Features

- **Centralized Algorithm Library:** Organize all your algorithms in one place, categorized and searchable.
- **Custom Progress Tracking:** Mark problems as Not Started, Reviewing, Mastered, or Deep Practice to monitor your growth.
- **Interactive Practice:** Type and submit your own solutions without seeing the answer right away.
- **Technique & Theory Reference:** Quickly review key techniques, patterns, and theoretical notes for each algorithm.
- **Personal Notes:** Add and update your own notes for every problem.
- **Review Scheduling:** Built-in reminders and review cycles to help you revisit and reinforce concepts.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and personalized dashboard.

## Why I Built AlgoAtlas

While learning algorithms, I found myself overwhelmed by scattered notes and files. I wanted a tool that would let me:

- Practice algorithms without being tempted by the answer.
- Track my progress and focus on weak areas.
- Keep concise, organized notes and revisit them easily.
- See techniques and theory at a glance for each problem.

AlgoAtlas is my solution—a platform that brings structure, focus, and efficiency to algorithm practice.
